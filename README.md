# GithubSlack-Automator

This is a helpful script that combines Github & Slack APIs to offer you a command line tool that:
- creates a private github repository
- adds a github collaborator to github orgnaization using his email
- adds the permission on the prevously created repository to the github user
- creates a slack conversation (& add existing members list to it)
- invites the user to the previously created slack conversation.

To get an idea of what are possible parameters and how you should call the script, you can run it with **--help** .
Please keep in mind that you need a github access token and a slack api token.
